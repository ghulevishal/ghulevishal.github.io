After lot of reading on blogs, finally I come back to wikipedia, where article give more insights, most of the parts of this section are copied from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93earnings_ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93earnings_ratio).


The price/earnings (often shortened to the P/E ratio or the PER) is the ratio of a company's stock price to the company's earnings per share. The ratio is used in valuing companies.


Companies with higher valuation, where investers are ready to pay today high today, or  the ratio is high. I t might be because the companies have higher expectation, the investor expects more returns from it. So high P/E ratio just says about market sentiments about the company. Today's P/E of 25 might be P/E of 15 is some years down the line as company has acheived growth.

High valuation companies and low valuation companies 

High P/E stocks are also called **Growth Stocks**, and low P/E ratio are called **Value stocks**
