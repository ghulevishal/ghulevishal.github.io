Few questions answer in geometry and understanding space time.

* When a curve is straight  ?
	* A curve is a **straight** , if  tangent vectors stay tangent when parallel transported along the curve.

* What is parallel transported ?
	* It means transferring things parallel, here moving vector together, working things in parallel or transposing parallely

* What is tangent vector ? 
	* Any vector that is tangent to curve is tangent vector.
	
* What is tangent ?
	* Tangent is curve is the line that touch it only at one point.

* What is curve ?
	* Object similar to a line but that need not be straight. Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line.
