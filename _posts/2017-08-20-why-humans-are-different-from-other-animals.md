Read this thought in the book "The GIRL who CHOSE" by Devdutt Pattanaik. He wrote --

>  Sita, her husband and her brother-in-law discovered in what ways animals are different from humans. Animals live by instinct. In order to survive, and to find food and mates, the strong use their strength and weak use their intelligence. They are programmed only to hlep their young, or other members of their own kind. Humans, however, can help anyone even strangers.
> 
> In the forest, there is no kindness or cruelty, no right or wrong - just the sruvival of the fittest. 
> 
> Ram, Sita and Laskhman realized that humans use choices and rules to create a world where there is more kindness and les cruelty, more right and less wrong.

Few things that I need to think, I used to think humans are no different, no high no low, we're just species like all others species on planet, but his thought does make sense too. We can do that unlike other animals. We see once-in-a-while example where a tiger shown kindess or love(care) towards his food or other species, but humans have every now and then show love to animals, but might be because we're in abudance. 

It's like rich(who have sense of safety) has think for others things because their basic needs are taken care of, but poor can't because if they're hungry, only thing that hungry guy can think of is food, morality and other things go out of line and so does care.  Many contradictory thought coming in mind, but for now will take a break will come with some other frame of mind and update it.
