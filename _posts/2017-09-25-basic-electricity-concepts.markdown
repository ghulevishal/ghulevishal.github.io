Electricity is flow of elctrons from -ve terminal to +ve terminal, it is just that. The simple way to  get this flow if by using the batteries, now lets start go to deep down.


* Battery is a chemical device designed to create the force needed to move electron, 
    * conductors like copper if connected postive and negative terminal of battery, give a path for flowing of electron

    * What is electron
        * Electron is the basic particle we know, that explains the flow of electricity.
        * We take that is exist and responsible for flow of elecricity
        * Charge of proton/electron is **1.6 * 10 <sup>-19</sup>C**

    * What is charge and how is it calculated ?
        * Charge is the fundamental property we take that it exist.
        * Charge is the property of matter to interact with electromagnetic field, analogous to [masses](/mass_vs_matter_vs_weight.html) in gravitational field (but, much more stronger!).
        * There is not way to visualize it.
        * There's no convincing definition for these things.We can only know/talk about the characteristics of such a thing, because all we know (based on observation) is that when we account for something like the charge, we can explain some of the phenomena happening in nature.
        * Since there is not way to visualize, then there's no way you can be convinced, except believe that something like that really exists.
        * We need a few base items to describe the phenomena happening in the outside world. And, charge is one among them!
        * It was calculated by [Oil_drop_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment) and we take that number.

    * Same charge repel each other and opposite charge attract each other

    * Electrons have negative charge(a standard we say, there is nothing like negative to it. We say it negative just because of historic reason, it can be also be said **charge of type A** ), they travel from -ve end of the battery and are attracted to +ve end.

    * Flowing electrons are called electric current, it is measured in Amperes.

    * Current tells the rate of flow of electron
        * 1 Amps(Ampere) means  1 Coulombs per second
        * 1 Columb is lots of charge, we will ever see in our life, we work with micro-columb.
        * An electron has a charge of 1.60 x 10^-19 coulombs
        * 6.25 x 10^18 electrons to make up 1 coulomb of charge.

    * Path electic current follows is called circuit.
    * Force moving the electron to +ve end is volatge and is measured in Volts 
    * Typical AA battery is 1.5V, this is small force and would not give us shock
        * As this force will not move electron so fast 
        * 120V or 220V is dangerous

    * Never directly connect +ve and -ive end of battery, it is called short-circuit.
        * In short-circuit, there is no resistance for current flow, so all the electron rust towards the positive end
        * It causes lot of heat-generation and as there is lot of movement towards the +ive terminal


* Conductor are element which have small sections of electron which are free to move around conductors(again a theory we believe in).

* Non-conductor all electrons are bind to atoms.

Other than battery we can use **silk and glass experiment** to see electric charges and some of their behaviour.

* When we rub the glass rod with silk cloth, glass gets different type of behaviour and silk gets different one.
* The glass rods now attracts a conductor, silk cloth repels the conductor
* We get two different behaviours here, to understand them we made some conventions we say them as.
    * They are with some **charge** now,
    * One has positive charge and other has negative charge.
    * OR you've could said one has charge A other has charge B or anything else but both has different one.

* What happens in above experiment is (**it's a theory currently all science people believe in, something new can come up too**) :
    * Glass happens to lose electrons easily, and silk grabs them away from the glass atoms, so after rubbing the glass becomes positively charged and the silk becomes **negatively(or type B)** charged.

* Similarly if we rub the rubber-rod with cat-fur the the rubber-rod said to have lose got electron hence move of type B charge.

* How rubbing causes this charging
    * Rubber attracts for electrons more than animal fur.
    * So while rubbing atoms of rubber pull electrons from the atoms of animal fur.
    * Some particle attracts electron and some lose it up
    * Similar when you comb your hairs, the comb gets +ve charge, it losses electron and hairs attract them.


Basic concepts are covered up electricity are covered up, add will keep adding them if something else comes to my mind
